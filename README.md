### This new one fetches a script from this repo which is useful for using inside of another script.

```
sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt update -y && sudo apt autoremove -y &&
sudo apt install wget &&
sudo apt-get install --reinstall ca-certificates -y &&
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brettjrea/Debian_Strapi_Backend_API/main/install-strapi.sh &&
chmod +x install-strapi.sh &&
./install-strapi.sh &&
sudo apt autoremove -y &&
sudo apt clean -y
```

```
cd my-backend && yarn deploy
```
I seperated the command to start development because I am using PM2 from the link below. ðŸ‘‡

*You might now want to [Configure PM2](https://github.com/brettjrea/Debian_Configure_PM2) a node based Process mananger to launch the strapi backend and Gatsby frontend with one command from the terminal to run at the same time in the background so you can still use your terminal.*

### This is a copy-paste oneliner. 

```
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y && 
sudo apt autoremove -y &&
sudo apt install libvips libvips-dev libvips-tools python gir1.2-vips-8.0 make g++ -y && 
npm install -g yarn && 
yarn global add pm2 &&
yarn create strapi-app my-backend --quickstart --no-run && 
cd my-backend && echo "18.14.2" > .nvmrc && 
npm run develop
```
